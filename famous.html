          <p><img src="http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/nhl/blog/Jaromir_Jagr_Is_Ageless.jpg" width="300" height="200" hspace="15" align="left"/>Jaromir Jagr (born February 15, 1972) is a Czech hockey player currently playing for the Florida Panthers in the National Hockey League. He has formerly played with the Pittsburgh Penguins; winning two Stanley Cups, the Washington Capitals, the New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins and New Jersey Devils. He also has played in the Kontinental Hockey League; for the team Avangard Omsk.</p>
          <p>Jágr is the leading all-time point scorer among active NHL players. He is the most productive European player who has ever played in the NHL and is considered one of the greatest professional hockey players of all time. In 1990, at age 18, he was the youngest player in the NHL. Currently, at age 44, he is the oldest player in the NHL, and is the oldest player to record a hat-trick.</p>

He won consecutive Stanley Cups in the 1991 and 1992 seasons with the Penguins. Individually, he has won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL scoring champion five times (four times in a row), the Lester B. Pearson Award for the NHL's outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) three times and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League's most valuable player once, while being a finalist an additional four times.
      
      For two decades, from 1981 to 2001, only three players won the Art Ross Trophy as the leading point-scorer over the regular season: Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Jágr. Jágr has won the award the most of any non-Canadian player.
      
      Jágr is also one of only 27 hockey players in the Triple Gold Club, individuals who have played for teams that have won the Stanley Cup (1991, 1992), the Ice Hockey World Championships (2005, 2010) and the Olympic gold medal in ice hockey (1998). Jágr is one of only two Czech players (the other being Jiří Šlégr) in the Club, achieving this feat in 2005. Jágr was the Czech Republic's flag bearer at the 2010 Winter Olympics.</p>
